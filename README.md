# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a simple Bash-based project to calculate simple interest using user-provided inputs.

## Project Description
The Simple Interest Calculator computes simple interest based on the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate of Interest × Time) / 100

The project is created to demonstrate basic GitHub repository structure, open-source documentation, and Git/GitHub workflows.

## Technologies Used
- Bash Shell Script
- Git
- GitHub

## How It Works
The script prompts the user to enter:
- Principal amount
- Rate of interest
- Time period (in years)

It then calculates and displays the simple interest.
